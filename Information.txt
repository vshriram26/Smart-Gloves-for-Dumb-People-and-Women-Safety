The Smart Glove for Communication and Women Safety is a practical, low-cost wearable system that successfully combines gesture recognition with real-time cloud-based messaging using the Telegram API. This project was conceptualized with two core objectives: first, to assist individuals with speech impairments in expressing basic messages through simple hand gestures; and second, to empower women with a discreet and rapid way to send an emergency alert in dangerous situations.
Using the ESP32 microcontroller, metal rings for gesture detection, and a Telegram bot for communication, the system proved to be highly effective, fast, and user-friendly. A simple touch between the thumb and any of the other fingers triggered a predefined message sent to a Telegram chat, while an index-finger touch specifically activated a “Help me!” alert — providing a powerful yet silent safety mechanism.
Throughout testing, the system demonstrated high gesture recognition accuracy, reliable Telegram message delivery, and instant LED feedback for user confirmation. The replacement of complex sensors with conductive rings made the glove extremely affordable and robust, while the use of ESP32 allowed seamless wireless communication without the need for additional modules like GSM or Bluetooth.
Moreover, the glove is lightweight, portable, and can be powered using a compact power bank, making it practical for real-world, daily use. Its dual-purpose design — communication aid and emergency response — highlights its flexibility and social relevance, especially for vulnerable groups.
This project also opens up new possibilities for future enhancements, including:
	Integration of voice playback using a DFPlayer (for audio-based alerts)
	GPS tracking support during emergency mode
	Touch pattern customization via a mobile app
	Enhanced glove comfort and weatherproofing
In conclusion, this smart glove demonstrates how embedded systems, when thoughtfully combined with IoT platforms like Telegram, can lead to meaningful, life-enhancing solutions. It serves as a strong foundation for future innovations in the field of wearable assistive technology and personal safety.
