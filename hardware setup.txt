 Metal Rings
	Type Used: Conductive metal rings or copper pads attached to glove fingers and thumb.
	Function: When a finger touches the thumb, an electrical connection is created.
	Detection Logic: ESP32 pins are configured as INPUT_PULLUP. A touch causes the pin to read LOW.
 ESP32 Microcontroller
	Role: Core controller handling gesture detection and message transmission.
	Advantages:
	Built-in Wi-Fi
	Multiple GPIOs
	Compact size
	Compatible with Arduino IDE
	Wiring:
	Each finger ring → individual GPIO (e.g., D2, D4, D5, D18, D19)
	Thumb ring → GND
 LED Indicator
	Purpose: Blinks when a valid touch is detected and a message is being sent.
	Wiring:
	Positive (anode) → GPIO pin (e.g., D21)
	Negative (cathode) → GND
	Function: Gives visual confirmation for successful gesture recognition
